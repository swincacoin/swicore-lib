## Building the Browser Bundle

To build a bitcore-lib-colx full bundle for the browser:

```sh
gulp browser
```

This will generate files named `bitcore-lib-colx.js` and `bitcore-lib-colx.min.js`.

## Development & Tests

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deltaengine/bitcore-lib-colx
cd bitcore-lib-colx
npm install
```

Run all the tests:

```sh
gulp test
```

You can also run just the Node.js tests with `gulp test:node`, just the browser tests with `gulp test:browser`
or create a test coverage report (you can open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` to visualize it) with `gulp coverage`.
